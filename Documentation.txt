Short summary:
Test report is in test_report.html.
Last test is failed, but it would pass. During test execution I triggered some manual API calls, and 'request_available' was lower than for loop.
Code was created in python request but also I did some manual testing with
Postman to check how endpoint behave.
It is alarming that Endpoint is working correctly (200 response and text was translated) even without correct header structure(missing
all parameters expect authorization)
Translation is working mostly correctly but translated sentence is containing  '.' at the end of each sentence
where input text did not.
There should be error handler if parameter in header is missing or it is empty.
Most of parameters in header can be empty and it is still working f.e X-Opera-UI-Language or x-opera-timezone.
Also API code response is incorrect for empty token (500 instead of 401)
Continue of conversation works only in english only for "selected_text": "Continue conversation".
There is no needed to pass conversation_id, and also I was unable to reach continue conversation after response


For future I would focus more on some kind of SQL injection in header or Selected_text.
Also I didn't check the performance of Endpoint. During manual testing response was below 0.5s but during 2000 iteration loop it takes
3240 seconds for about 1900 request so it would be around 1.5-1.7 sec per request.
